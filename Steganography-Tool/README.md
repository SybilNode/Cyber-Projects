# LSB Steganography Tool

An educational Python tool for hiding secret messages inside images using the **Least Significant Bit (LSB)** technique. Built to demonstrate core concepts in cybersecurity, image processing, and Python software architecture.

## What Is Steganography?

Think about cryptography for a second — encrypting a message in plain sight. Even if everyone knows the message has been sent, they can't figure out what it means.

Steganography is a step further. We're not just scrambling the message — we're **hiding the fact that it's even there in the first place.**

Like writing a message with invisible ink. Only the person receiving it would know to look. Anyone else reading it might find it interesting, but only the recipient can read the secret message hidden inside.

## How LSB Works

The most simple form of steganography is **LSB — Least Significant Bit**.

It refers to the rightmost bit in a binary number. It holds the lowest value, so it's the bit with the least amount of weight. That means we can change it to contain our encoded message and have a near imperceptible change on the actual image — visually, nothing looks different.

We change the last bit (or last two bits) of every byte in the image. Every byte has 8 bits — so if we change the last two, the remaining six still come from the legitimate image. Those two changed bits carry our secret message.

**Example:** The color value `11001010` becomes `11001011` after embedding one bit. The color shifts by 1 out of 255 — completely invisible to the human eye.

> **Why PNG and BMP only?** Formats like JPEG use lossy compression, which modifies pixel values during saving and destroys any hidden data. PNG and BMP are lossless — what you write is exactly what gets saved.

## Features

- Hide a text message inside a PNG or BMP image
- Extract a hidden message from an encoded image
- Optional password-based encryption before embedding
- Capacity validation — warns if the message is too large for the image
- Clean command-line interface
